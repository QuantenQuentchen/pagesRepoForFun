                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Late Revolutionary Period (Standard Years 1999–2021) represents the transition from 
                            underground resistance to total planetary civil war. Characterized by extreme brutality, 
                            asymmetric tactics, and the eventual collapse of the Theocratic Regime, this era 
                            transformed the disparate syndicalist cells into the organized military and political 
                            force that founded the Stellar Syndicate.
                        </p>

                        <h2>From Resistance to Civil War</h2>
                        <p>
                            The formation of the <strong>Underground Congress</strong> in 1998 provided the 
                            organizational framework for coordination, yet the resistance remained a heterogeneous 
                            coalition. Far from a monolithic entity, the movement was composed of autonomous 
                            <strong>Workers' Councils</strong>, <strong>Synthetic Liberation Fronts</strong>, 
                            regional <strong>Mutual Aid Militias</strong>, and <strong>Defector Scholastic Circles</strong>. 
                            While the Congress established strategic priorities, local cells maintained high degrees 
                            of tactical and ideological independence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The conflict quickly shed any pretense of a simple insurgency. It transitioned into a 
                            protracted planetary conflict, often characterized as a civil war that fractured 
                            societal units down to the familial level. The Regime's "Guardians of Faith" 
                            found themselves in direct opposition to the "People's Militia"—a loosely federated 
                            paramilitary arm of regional councils.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Brutality of the Counter-Insurgency</h3>
                        <p>
                            As the Regime felt its grip slipping, its methods became increasingly desperate and 
                            indiscriminate. The lessons of the <em>Week of Faith</em> (1975) were applied with 
                            mechanical precision. Captured revolutionaries were not merely executed; they were 
                            subjected to horrific biological and psychological "re-education" protocols. The Regime 
                            weaponized its remaining technological advantages to conduct mass-scale punitive 
                            expeditions against districts suspected of syndicalist sympathies.
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "They don't want us to just die; they want us to be unmade. To have our very 
                            existence erased by the 'Darkness' they claim to worship. We do not fear the 
                            void anymore; we have been living in it for centuries." <br>
                            — <em>Field Commander Kael, log entry during the Siege of the Sunken Spires, 2012.</em>
                        </blockquote>

                        <h2>Asymmetric Warfare & Strategic Sabotage</h2>
                        <p>
                            Vastly outgunned by the Regime's orbital assets and corporate-funded heavy armor, the 
                            Revolutionary forces turned to <strong>Asymmetric Warfare</strong>. Success relied 
                            heavily on the exploitation of logistical bottlenecks and the neutralization of the 
                            Regime's communication networks.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Infrastructure Neutralization:</strong> Militia sappers focused on the 
                                destruction of transport hubs and energy distribution centers, effectively 
                                isolating Regime garrisons from their supply lines.</li>
                            <li><strong>Synthetic Electronic Warfare:</strong> Sapient synthetic entities, 
                                having joined the revolution following the early ideological shifts in the Kaelion 
                                shipyards, operated as "Ghost Units." They infiltrated corporate networks, 
                                causing widespread automation failures and disrupting the Regime's ability to 
                                coordinate large-scale military maneuvers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Urban Guerrilla Tactics:</strong> In the densely populated manufacturing 
                                hubs, local councils perfected the art of the 'short-range strike,' utilizing 
                                knowledge of industrial conduits and service tunnels to bypass Regime checkpoints.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Civilian Bombings</h3>
                        <p>
                            In its effort to gain ground, expand operational capacities, and break the will of the regime.
                            The usage of civilian bombings, the targeting og non-military infrastructure and population
                            centers, became a common occurrence. In isolated cases even using <em>Non-Baryonic-Explosives</em>
                            (NBEs). These tactics remain a controversial subject in modern discourse, with debates centering on the
                            ethical implications of such actions versus their strategic necessity in the context of a
                            liberation endeavor.

                            <strong>The Syndicate officially condemns the use of civilian bombings in all forms.</strong>
                            The usage of civilian bombings has been addressed extensively in multiple conventions by the
                            RJC. The Degree of punishment remains a widely debated matter ethicists, and historians.

                            <strong>Most common arguments defending</strong> these actions cite that these actions were often a
                            response to the Regime's own indiscriminate violence against civilian populations, as well
                            as a desperate measure taken in the face of overwhelming odds.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Most common arguments condemning</strong> these actions cite the moral cost of
                            targeting non-combatants, the long-term societal trauma inflicted, and the potential for
                            such tactics to undermine the legitimacy of the revolutionary cause.

                            "I cannot, and will not categorically forbid the use of civilian bombings for our cause.
                            I like most of us find this tactic deplorable. And I urge every member of the revolutionary
                            militia to carefully consider their usage of the tactic. Our lines are
                            overstretched, our enemy is relentless and seeks nothing but our total destruction. Our backs
                            have been against the wall ever since the Week [of Faith]. Moral high ground is a luxury we
                            cannot afford. And I will not send out orders and directives curtailing the ability of our
                            comrades to defend themselves, to push their lines forward. I hope one day a future generation
                            can wake up in a world, not experiencing the realities of war, capable of
                            condemning such actions. But that day is not today."<br>

                        <p>
                            The battle for the Sunken Spires is documented as one of the war's most grueling maritime 
                            campaigns. For three months, the Regime utilized the civilian maritime population as 
                            territorial shields, anchoring their orbital-defense satellite array directly above salt-farm 
                            clusters. The eventual Syndicate victory was facilitated by a high-risk underwater 
                            operation by the <strong>Synthetic Marine Divisions</strong>, who successfully 
                            destabilized the array's maritime stabilizers, leading to the physical collapse of the 
                            Regime's dominant naval presence in the region.

                        <h2>Revolutionary Justice Council</h2>
                        <p>
                            Following the surrender of the Regime in 2021, the <strong>Revolutionary Justice 
                            Council</strong> was convened to address the atrocities committed during the previous 
                            centuries. The Council's mandate was to investigate and adjudicate crimes against the 
                            populace, with a specific focus on the catastrophic events of the <strong>Week of 
                            Faith</strong> (1975) and subsequent decades of oppression.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Council meticulously documented the Regime's use of <strong>Non-Baryonic Matter 
                            (NBM)</strong> as a tool of terror. Evidence revealed that during the Week of Faith, 
                            the Regime deployed unstable NBM-derived warheads and utilized 'Non-Baryonic-Baryon 
                            Reactions' as a method of agonizing public execution—a process euphemistically 
                            labeled as "divine ascending" by the clergy. These acts were identified not merely 
                            as war crimes, but as a systematic attempt to utilize the fundamental physics of 
                            the universe for psychological subjugation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The proceedings led to the execution of over 20,000 high-ranking officials, 
                            researchers, and military commanders who were found directly complicit in these 
                            operations. However, the Council's most debated legacy remains its stance on the 
                            NBM technology itself. While recognizing the material's potential for energy and 
                            scientific advancement, the inherent danger demonstrated by the Regime's misuse 
                            created a profound ethical schism within the early Syndicate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, the Revolutionary Justice Council chose to <strong>postpone the matter of 
                            the continued usage and research of Non-Baryonic Matter</strong>. The Council 
                            decreed that such a decision could only be made once more stable governance 
                            structures were in place, deferring the issue to a future <strong>intersectional 
                            conference of scientific, citizens, military, and governmental councils</strong> yet to 
                            be established.

                        <p>
                            The actions of the Revolutionary Justice Council remain one of the most divisive 
                            topics in modern historical discourse. Positions range from those justifying its 
                            brutality as a regrettable necessity to ensure the Theocratic Regime could never 
                            re-emerge, to those who condemn the Council for the sheer scale of the executions, 
                            arguing that the Syndicate's foundations were stained by the very violence it sought 
                            to overthrow. The reader is invited to form their own judgement on the morality of 
                            these actions, as the archive presents the following records not as a moral 
                            consensus, but as the factual conclusion of the revolutionary era.

                        <h2>The Toll of Victory</h2>

                            The conclusion of the war left the planetary surface deeply scarred. Strategic
                            sabotage and the misuse of industrial-scale materials rendered several former hubs 
                            uninhabitable, creating restricted zones that remain under environmental 
                            monitoring. Beyond the physical damage, the new Syndicate faced the monumental task of 
                            reconciling a divided population, integrating millions of former collaborators and 
                            conscripts into a society based on horizontal cooperation rather than divine hierarchy.
