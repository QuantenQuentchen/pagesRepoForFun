                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>
                            At what exact point in history the theocratic regime as we know it today began to shape, is
                            currently a matter of active research. However, it generally is assumed to have emerged in the
                            16th century, either as a result of the diplomatic unification or conquest by a dominant
                            religious power. It is generally assumed that the rise of the Regime was facilitated, by both
                            options, although other theories exist. Research on this matter is challenging, due to the lack
                            of any reliable sources, or historic documentation. It was propagandized that the regime
                            has always existed, and that it was given a divine mandate to rule. Internal policy was
                            the destruction of any evidence to the contrary.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Emergence</h3>

                        <p>
                            Anecdotal and oral evidence suggests that the regime began to take it's current shape in the
                            16th century. The exact geopolitical landscape in which it emerged is to date unclear.
                            However, there are strong indicators that alternative forms of governance existed before it.
                            All of which shaped by the natural occurrence of <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em>. Whether
                            this has lead to theological components, in every pre-regime society is still a matter of
                            active research. Due to the nature of <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em>, which can only be
                            described as 'mystical' in a time before modern research, it is, however, generally assumed so.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Soon after the theocratic regime had established itself globally, it began the distribution
                            of religious texts, construction of religious sites, and created a mandatory global religious
                            schooling system. Which is assumed to be the reason for the lack of a diverse language ecosystem.
                            Divergant languages from <em>The language of the Gods</em> are assumed to have existed once.
                            Their only lingustical remains today, however, are local dialects of <em>The language of the Gods</em>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Reverence for Non-Baryonic Matter</h3>
                        <p>
                            <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em> colloquially called 'Dark Matter' today, played a major role as
                            the theological foundation for the regime. Sites with high concentrations of
                            <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em> were considered sacred and often became pilgrimage destinations.
                            The regime established strict control over these sites, regulating access and
                            rituals performed there. The clergy claimed to have a unique ability to interact with
                            <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em>, further solidifying their authority and divine status.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Myths about the divinity of <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em> persisted well into the early
                            revolutionary period. We know today that the regime's clergy were actually better understood
                            as a group of researchers. Even if it did not disclose it publicly, the regime undertook
                            immense efforts to research the properties of <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em>. Many contradictory
                            actions taken by the regime are directly explained by their desire to exploit
                            <em>Non-Baryonig Matter</em> not only as a foundation for religious belief, but for industrial
                            and military means too
                        </p>

                        <h3>Creation of the first Synthetic entity</h3>

                        <p>
                            Due to the danger of <em>Non-Baryonic baryonic Reactions</em> a deadly, and painful
                            effect if 'Normal Matter' interacts with 'Dark Matter', research and manipulation of
                            <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em> was inherently dangerous to researchers and workers. With
                            the regime predominantly using political prisoners, and dissidents as labor force for
                            especially dangerous situations. A practice not only deplorable, but also inefficient, and
                            wasteful of resources.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1851, the regime issued <em>Secret Order: 1633</em> to create a safer system to research
                            manipulate and control <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em>. The order was issued to both internal
                            ministries and corporations. Amongst the different effects of the order, none are as impactful
                            as the creation of the first Synthetic entity. Altho originally created only for limited
                            operations, specifically concerning <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em>, Synthetic entities were
                            soon commercialized and allocated in massive quantities to both the regime's military forces.

                            The organizational realities of the regime, even if self described as being of religious nature.
                            Is much better understood as a merger of Profit seeking private corporations and the church.
                            Forming a governmental body that was organizationally inefficient, redundant, overlapping
                            and unstable. There are no recorded cases of natural death amongst the leading figures of the
                            regime. All of which either having been replaced by corporate interests, or by their own
                            clergy.

                        <h3>Government</h3>
                        <p>
                            Day-to-day governance was facilitated by a complex beurocracy, fundamentally under the oversight
                            of the <em>High Clergy</em>. While this might have been the case on paper, the reality was that
                            there was no clear distinction between Governance, and economy. Many high-ranking officials held
                            dual roles in both the governmental and corporate sectors. Enforcement often being delegated
                            to private entities. Laws were selectively applied, often contradictory, often cannonicized
                            versions of company Codes of Conduct.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong><em>High Clergy:</em></strong> The High Clergy was the nominative ruling authority.
                            It elected the <em>Supreme Priest</em>, high clergy members were appointed for life.
                            Any member of the High Clergy could appoint at most one Member of the <em>Low Clergy</em>
                            as their successor. In reality however, these restrictions where seldom enforced, infighting,
                            factionalism, coups, and political power plays were rampant. With recorded instances of one
                            Member, appointing 2-10 other members directly into the <em>High Clergy</em>. The
                            <em>High Clergy</em> was made up of 11 members.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong><em>Low Clergy:</em></strong> The low Clergy was the combination of all religious
                            personals, from heads of unimportant religious sites, to massively important religious figures.
                            Everyone considered a citizen could in theory join its ranks, after extensive theological education
                            training, oaths, and background checks. An option a lot of citizens took, at times the
                            <em>Low Clergy</em>. There were no Limits to the number of members.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong><em>Ministries:</em></strong> Ministries were governmental bodies under the direct
                            and sole control of the <em>Supreme Priest</em>. The amount of ministries varied significantly
                            over time, with the <em>Supreme Priest</em> having the power to create new ones, or abolish
                            old ones at any time. Appointments as Ministers were largely based on political
                            There was no formal required structure to Ministries, beyond having a Minister at its head.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong><em>Supreme Priest:</em></strong> The Supreme Priest was the ruling figure of the
                            regime. The Priest had absolute authority, on all matters. Generally delegating it's
                            personal power to Ministries.

                        <h3>Military Organizations</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the history of the regime there have been a variety of military, para-military, and pseudo
                            military forces. With often overlapping and unclear authority.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong><em>Keepers of Faith:</em></strong> The keepers acted as the de-facto police force,
                            enforcing both governmental laws, and private company codes alike. The Keepers were structured
                            similarly to the Military, with similar ranks, training and equipment. It maintained it's own
                            intelligence service the <em>Eye of God</em>. It was the main coercive power used by the regime
                            in the early stages of the revolution.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong><em>Military:</em></strong> The military similarly to the <em>Keepers of Faith</em>
                            was an amalgamation of various private military corporations and regime controlled forces.
                            Its exact purpose is to date unclear, as it still received a large amount of resources, in
                            a time at which no external threat to the regime existed. It is assumed that it either maintained
                            relevance due to internal power struggles, or that the regime was operationally unable to
                            disband it. Its main documented usage was in conjunction with the <em>Keepers of Faith</em>
                            for situations requiring large-scale force. It was extensively used and expanded during the
                            late revolutionary period. It maintained its own intelligence service the <em>Office for Heresy</em>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Intelligence</h3>

                        <p>
                            Beyond the internal intelligence services of various military organizations. Different
                            ministries and corporations had their own intelligence agencies. All of which operating in
                            parallel, often adverserial. The historically most significant of which where:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong><em>Ministry of Care:</em></strong> The Ministry of Care was tasked with maintaing
                            incarceration systems. It operated a large network of prisons, labor camps, and
                            re-education facilities. Maintaining its own intelligence service that mainly operated
                            within these facilities. Historically it has operated under different names, 2 of which are
                            known, <em>Office of Inmate Health</em>, and <em>Office of inmate security</em>. It is not
                            entirely clear of these were merely different names for the same organization, or if they were
                            separate entities. It presented the main thread to organization within incarceration facilities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong><em>Ministry of Surveillance:</em></strong> The Ministry of Surveillance was responsible
                            for the collection and analysis of intelligence data. It operated a vast network of agents,
                            and surveillance facilities. It is important to note that this did not give the Ministry of
                            Surveillance any sort of primacy, in matters of Intelligence. It like all other intelligence
                            services that operated within the regime, were of equal standing within it. As the only intelligence
                            agency, that did not operate from within another ministry, or military entity. It is historically
                            significant due to its sheer scale
                        </p>

                        <h3>Corporations</h3>

                        <p>
                            Corporations within the regime operated, closely, often in conjunction with the military, the
                            <em>High Clergy</em> and the <em>Supreme Priest</em>. Many corporations held de-facto governmental
                            power, with some corporations even holding seats within the <em>High Clergy</em>. Corporations
                            were often given governmental contracts, and special privileges, in exchange for their loyalty
                            to the regime. The largest and most influential corporations often had their own private military
                            forces, intelligence services, and enforcement agencies.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All corporations within the regime were <em>Capitalist</em> entities. They operated as publicly
                            traded operations, within a <em>pseudo-market</em> system. Their primary purpose was
                            the accumulation of wealth and concentration of power.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong><em>Pseudo-Market:</em></strong> A pseudo-market is an economic system that is similar
                            to the dynamics of a libertarian capitalist market. But with extremely operational ties to the
                            government and each other. Which prevents the market to function as a normal market, as described
                            by libertarian theory. In contemporary economic science it is assumed, that any market, within
                            a capitalist economic organizational model, will inherently at some point degrade into a
                            <em>Pseudo-Market</em>.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Theology</h2>
                        <p>
                            The theology of the regime is largely based on the reverence of <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em>.
                            Its theology was monotheistic and centered around the myth that <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em>
                            and its properties are a sign of a divine being. The regime's religious texts describe a pantheon of deities,
                            with a supreme deity often referred to as <em>The Divine Source</em>. The theology emphasized obedience,
                            sacrifice, and the pursuit of spiritual purity. It also incorporated elements of mysticism
                            and ritualistic practices, many of which were centered around the interaction with
                            <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is important to note that the regime did not believe in its own theology, using it as a
                            tool for oppression, and control of the populace. To date there is no scientific evidence
                            supporting any part of regime scripture, regime doctrine, or theology.
