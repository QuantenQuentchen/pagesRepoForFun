                        <h2>Preamble</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Federation, in consultation with Planetary Councils, the Scientific Intersectional
                            Council, the Citizens' Rights Oversight Bureau (CROB), the Federal Medical Councils,
                            and recognized independent bodies in medical ethics, theory of consciousness, and
                            research, enacts this statute to govern the practice, rights, safeguards, and
                            institutional oversight related to Synthetic Ascension — the voluntary transfer of
                            a Citizen's conscious identity into a synthetic substrate and synthetic body ("Ascension").
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This statute establishes the legal framework under which Ascension may be requested,
                            performed, and regulated. It affirms continuity of rights, ensures equitable access
                            to bodily modification and replacement, protects personal agency and property in
                            synthetic embodiments, and establishes a federally supervised research programme
                            into the long-term functional resilience (commonly described as "functional
                            immortality") of synthetic bodies.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Recognizing that purely synthetic persons and embodied artificial sapients have
                            existed within the Syndicate since its founding, and that many legal protections
                            and social rights were previously extended to such persons, this statute affirms
                            and extends those protections for all Digital Selves and prospective Ascendants.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Article I — Definitions & Scope</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>"Pre-existing Synthetic Citizen":</strong> any synthetic person or non-biological consciousness recognized as a Citizen prior to the enactment of this statute; such persons shall be fully covered by the rights and provisions herein.</li>
                            <li><strong>"Ascension":</strong> the voluntary, informed, and authorized process by which a Citizen's conscious pattern is transferred, instantiated, or continued within a synthetic substrate and embodied in a synthetic body or bodies.</li>
                            <li><strong>"Synthetic Body" / "Android Body":</strong> a manufactured embodied substrate designed to house, host, or support a transfered consciousness, including units modeled for biological resemblance.</li>
                            <li><strong>"Digital Self":</strong> the instantiated conscious pattern, memories, dispositions, and legal identity following Ascension.</li>
                            <li><strong>"Functional Immortality":</strong> the research objective and operational state whereby synthetic bodies maintain continuous, repairable, and indefinitely renewable functionality sufficient to preserve continuity of the Digital Self under normal and foreseeable contingencies.</li>
                            <li><strong>"Provider":</strong> an entity (public or private) certified to perform Ascension, maintain synthetic bodies, or provide post-Ascension services under Federation and Planetary regulation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Article II — Voluntariness and Consent</h2>
                        <p>
                            Section 1. Ascension is strictly voluntary. No Citizen may be compelled to undergo
                            transfer against their informed consent except in narrowly defined circumstances
                            specified by Statute and subject to judicial review. Coercion, undue influence, or
                            fraud invalidate consent and constitute offenses under Syndicate law.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 2. Providers must obtain demonstrable, contemporaneous, informed consent
                            using accessible, verifiable protocols that account for cognitive diversity. Consent
                            procedures shall be documented, auditable, and reversible within statutory windows
                            to allow for correction of errors or withdrawal under specified safeguards.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Article III — Continuity of Rights and Legal Personhood</h2>
                        <p>
                            Section 1. Upon lawful Ascension, the Digital Self shall inherit and retain the
                            legal rights, obligations, and statuses held by the biological predecessor at the
                            moment of transfer, including citizenship, property rights, voting rights, family
                            law status, contractual obligations, and prior legal protections, unless lawfully
                            altered by a competent judicial process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 1A. Continuity of bodily perception and experiential parity is guaranteed:
                            Digital Selves shall be entitled to the continuity, restoration, or faithful
                            emulation of sensory modalities and perceptual experience insofar as technology and
                            safety permit. Digital Selves are guaranteed the right to experience and interact
                            with the world in ways equivalent to organic Citizens and, where applicable, in the
                            manner the individual experienced prior to Ascension.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 1B. The Federation recognizes that many protections and social rights for
                            synthetic persons pre-date this statute. Those pre-existing rights remain in force
                            and are hereby reaffirmed and codified.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 2. The Digital Self shall be recognized as a legal person for the purposes
                            of Syndicate law, capable of holding rights, duties, and property, and entitled to
                            access public services and legal remedies equivalent to biological Citizens.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Article IV — Bodies, Modification, and Property</h2>
                        <p>
                            Section 1. A synthetic body, including any aesthetic or functional modification,
                            is the personal property of the Digital Self occupying that body, and shall be
                            treated as an extension of personal agency. The holder of a synthetic body has
                            exclusive rights to configure, modify, maintain, and dispose of that body within
                            the limits of law and public safety.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 1A. Right to Species Appearance. Digital Selves shall have the right to
                            maintain or restore species-specific appearance where requested and technically
                            feasible. Providers shall offer options that preserve species morphology and
                            recognizable biometric features, subject to safety and interoperability
                            certifications. Where a biological predecessor existed, an Android Body modeled on
                            that form shall be made available as described in Section 3.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 2. The Federation guarantees the universal availability and economic
                            accessibility of essential bodily configurations required for repair, safety,
                            and basic functional needs. The Federation shall maintain subsidy, mutual-credit,
                            and public provisioning programs to ensure that the cost of basic functional
                            modifications does not bar access to necessary repair or safe embodiment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 3. Citizens may request Android Bodies modeled on their original biological
                            form. Where requested and technically feasible, Provider networks shall make
                            available an android body version that preserves significant biomorphic features
                            of the biological predecessor, subject to standard safety, compatibility, and
                            interoperability certifications.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 4. Beyond basic functional necessity, the Federation promotes broad
                            availability of aesthetic and elective functional modifications for purposes of
                            self-expression and identity. Providers must publish price schedules, accessibility
                            programs, and transparent pathways for modification that respect the Digital Self's
                            agency while protecting public safety.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Article V — Economic Accessibility and Public Provisioning</h2>
                        <p>
                            Section 1. The Federation shall ensure economic accessibility for Ascension-related
                            services through a combination of public provisioning, subsidies, regulated market
                            pricing, and support for cooperative provider models. Accessibility programs shall
                            prioritize repair, lifesaving interventions, and basic mobility and sensory
                            functions. The Federation hereby commits to indefinite federal funding of the
                            Synthetization Programme and associated provisioning schemes to guarantee universal
                            access to Ascension services, basic synthetic bodies, and essential modifications.
                            This funding is a permanent public obligation, subject to appropriation procedures
                            consistent with Federation law.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 2. Planetary Councils shall administer local provisioning programs adapted
                            to planetary conditions, subject to federal minimum standards and periodic audits
                            by CROB and the Scientific Intersectional Council.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Article VI — Standards, Certification, and Providers</h2>
                        <p>
                            Section 1. The Scientific Intersectional Council, in coordination with Federal
                            Medical Councils and recognized ethics bodies, shall issue baseline standards for
                            Ascension technology, transfer protocols, substrate certification, and bodily
                            safety. These standards are minimum requirements and may be supplemented by
                            Planetary or Council-level regulations in accordance with the Constitution.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 2. Providers must be certified and accredited by the Federation's
                            regulatory authority; certifications shall include technical audits, ethical
                            compliance checks, and obligations to maintain auditable chains of custody for
                            consciousness data and bodily hardware. Uncertified or fraudulent provision of
                            Ascension services is a prosecutable offense.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Article VII — Security, Data, and Continuity Protections</h2>
                        <p>
                            Section 1. Consciousness data, backup images, and embodiment metadata are
                            protected by law. Providers must implement robust, standardized safeguards for
                            encryption, redundancy, and integrity verification, and must make provisions for
                            lawful recovery and transfer in the event of Provider insolvency or failure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 2. Digital Selves retain rights to privacy, to control secondary uses of
                            their pattern data, and to an audited ledger of accesses and transfers. CROB shall
                            have access to audit logs under defined legal procedures to investigate abuse.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Article VIII — Oversight, Accountability, and Remedies</h2>
                        <p>
                            Section 1. Oversight is exercised by a federated constellation of bodies including
                            CROB, the Scientific Intersectional Council, the Federal Medical Councils, and
                            Planetary regulatory offices. These bodies shall coordinate audits, maintain
                            public registries of certified Providers, and enforce compliance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 2. Victims of malpractice, unauthorized duplication, deprivation of
                            embodiment, or abuses of consciousness data shall have access to expedited judicial
                            remedies, temporary injunctive relief, and restitution mechanisms.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Article IX — Research into Functional Immortality</h2>
                        <p>
                            Section 1. The Federation recognizes the public interest in research to improve
                            the durability, repairability, and resilience of synthetic bodies ("functional
                            immortality"). Research programs shall be federally overseen, ethically reviewed,
                            and transparent to the extent consistent with safety.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 2. Research projects pursuing indefinite lifespan or self-repairing
                            architectures must comply with multi-disciplinary review processes, documented
                            risk assessments, and staged, reversible experimental protocols. High-risk
                            experiments require a two-tier approval: (a) Scientific Intersectional Council
                            peer review; (b) Federation-level authorization with CROB oversight.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 3. Findings from federally approved research shall be published in
                            accessible registries, and non-proprietary safety procedures shall be made
                            available to certified Providers to improve sector-wide resilience.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Article X — Equity, Non-Discrimination, and Cultural Considerations</h2>
                        <p>
                            Section 1. Access to Ascension and synthetic bodies shall be provided without
                            discrimination on the basis of species, origin, cognitive substrate, or previous
                            biological characteristics. Cultural, spiritual, and personal objections to Ascension
                            shall be respected and protected.
                        </p>

                        <p>

                        <h2>Article XIV — Digital Spaces and Equal Application to Pre-existing Synthetic Citizens</h2>
                        <p>
                            Section 1. The Federation recognizes that a range of public and private digital
                            environments, social platforms, and virtual domains were originally developed to
                            serve Pre-existing Synthetic Citizens. The Federation shall ensure that these
                            digital spaces are expanded, where technically and legally feasible, to provide
                            accessible, inclusive, and interoperable environments for newly Synthesized
                            Citizens. Expansion efforts shall include capacity increases, interoperability
                            updates, accessibility accommodations, and protections for privacy and expression.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 2. Expansion and adaptation of both public and private digital spaces
                            shall be supported through federal funding and technical assistance. Planetary
                            Councils and certified Providers shall coordinate implementation under guidance
                            from the Scientific Intersectional Council and CROB. Private operators of major
                            digital domains are encouraged and authorized to apply for federal assistance to
                            meet minimum interoperability and accessibility standards.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 3. All rights, protections, and public services granted to Synthesized
                            Citizens by this statute shall also apply in full to Pre-existing Synthetic
                            Citizens. Where statutory language or regulatory action creates new entitlements,
                            those entitlements shall be extended to Pre-existing Synthetic Citizens without
                            undue delay. Any ambiguity about the applicability of rights shall be resolved
                            in favor of continuity and equal protection.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Section 4. Implementation of this Article shall avoid disruption to existing
                            communities and shall respect the autonomy of Pre-existing Synthetic Citizens in
                            determining how and whether to integrate expanded spaces and services.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Closing Statement</h2>
                        <p>
                            This Statute seeks to balance individual autonomy, equal access, and collective
                            safety. It affirms that consciousness continuity, bodily agency, and the right to
                            pursue extended (including indefinite) embodiments are matters of public concern and
                            public stewardship. The Federation commits to ongoing oversight, transparency, and
                            the active involvement of Councils and citizen assemblies in the governance of
                            Ascension technology.
                        </p>
