                            <strong>ARCHIVE NOTE:</strong> For abbreviated reading and to understand the original
                            normative intent behind the Constitution of the Stellar Syndicate of Free Worlds, it is
                            recommended to read the Foundational Papers. The Foundational Papers represents the to date
                            legally enforced outline of the Constitution
                        </div>

                        <h2>Preamble</h2>
                        <p>
                            We, the assembled delegates and citizens of the free councils, in order to secure the
                            guarantees of liberty, equality, and mutual responsibility for all sapient beings within
                            and under the protection of the Stellar Syndicate of Free Worlds, do hereby ordain and
                            establish this Constitution as the supreme foundational law of the Syndicate. This
                            instrument draws upon the revolutionary writings and practical guidance of the Early
                            Revolutionary Period — notably the corpus known as <em>The Workers Papers</em>, including
                            the <em>Workers Manifesto</em> and the <em>Worker's Tools</em> — and translates those
                            principles into enforceable legal provisions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This text is a constitutional summary intended for publication in the Archives and for
                            public reference. It is not, in all respects, the exact letter of every implementing
                            statute or instrument; where finer legal detail is required, the codified statutes,
                            implementing regulations, and registries shall be consulted as authoritative.
                        </p>

                            </li>

                             protections and operational interoperability. Councils, Federations, and Participatory

                             rights guaranteed at higher levels. This approach seeks to ensure minimum uniformity

                            enable the Syndicate's participation in a wider intersystem community governed by law and
                            mutual respect.
