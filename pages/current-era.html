                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Current Era documents the formal consolidation of revolutionary gains into a durable
                            political and social order: the Stellar Syndicate. Born from decades of clandestine
                            organization, civil conflict, and the post-war adjudication process, the Syndicate is
                            founded explicitly on a written constitution that draws its governance principles from
                            the revolutionary corpus produced during the Early Revolutionary Period — the collective
                            writings known as <em>The Workers Papers</em>, and, in particular, the practical collections
                            known as the <em>Workers Manifesto</em> and the <em>Worker's Tools</em> — adapted for
                            planetary and interstellar scale.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Constitution</h2>
                        <p>
                            Ratified by a confederation of Workers' Councils, the constitution is a compact of
                            decentralized governance, mutual aid obligations, and procedural safeguards to prevent
                            concentration of authority. Its core articles establish:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Council Sovereignty:</strong>
                                Local councils retain autonomy over purely local matters while delegating
                                federated powers to assemblies of mandates and recallable delegates.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Rotating Mandates:</strong>
                                Executives and coordinators serve fixed, revocable mandates with transparency
                                requirements and immediate recall procedures.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Economic Commons:</strong>
                                Strategic means of production and critical infrastructure are managed by democratically
                                controlled federations of worker collectives.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Citizenship &amp; Rights of Sapients:</strong>
                                Equal legal standing for all sentient actors under the law; protections explicitly
                                extended to synthetic beings and non-biological consciousness. The constitution
                                affirms that every sapient being discovered, born within Syndicate space, or
                                officially joining the Syndicate is a Citizen. Application toward citizenship is
                                maintained as a universally accessible option for any qualifying individual or
                                collective, and procedures for adjudication are public and non-discriminatory.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Distributed Judiciary:</strong>
                                Local restorative tribunals with a federated appeals process;
                                extraordinary crimes subject to transparent, cross-disciplinary review.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Structure and Institutions</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Syndicate preserves horizontalism while recognizing functional specialization. The principal organs are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Federation of Workers' Councils:</strong>
                                The primary legislative assembly, comprising mandated delegates from local councils.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Coordination Secretariat:</strong>
                                Administrative coordination for inter-council logistical needs;
                                strictly administrative and revocable by mandate.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Syndicate Defense Force:</strong>
                                Federated defense units under strict civilian oversight with defined rules of engagement.
                                Civilian bodies retain ultimate authority over strategic deployments.

                                <strong>Planetary Militia (Citizen Militia):</strong>
                                A universal, compulsory militia requiring nominal service from all Citizens. Organized
                                on principles of "soldier democracy" (unit councils elect and recall their
                                commanders, and policy decisions are subject to mandated consultation), the militia
                                serves local defense, civil assistance, and the security of critical infrastructure
                                including Hyperlane nodes. Membership, training, and exemptions are governed by
                                publicly available statutes and subject to oversight by civilian organs.

                        <h2>Justice, Memory, and the RJC</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Revolutionary Justice Council (RJC), convened at the end of hostilities, documented atrocities,
                            issued judgments, and recommended institutional reforms. Its proceedings produced contested
                            outcomes—large-scale prosecutions and the integration of many former functionaries into
                            supervised programs—while seeding the Syndicate's approach to transitional justice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The RJC also established strict controls on hazardous research and weaponization. Use of
                            Non-Baryonic Matter (NBM) in military applications was specifically cited as a principal
                            cause of mass atrocities and therefore became subject to moratoria and intersectional oversight.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Economy, Labor, and Reconstruction</h2>
                        <p>
                            Reconstruction prioritized collective ownership of essential industries and a mix of
                            decentralised planning with local marketplace mechanisms for non-strategic goods. The
                            Syndicate instituted a system of mutual credit between councils, comprehensive social
                            services, and prioritized restoration of transportation and energy grids destroyed during
                            the Late Revolutionary conflict.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Technology and the Ethics of Power</h2>
                        <p>
                            Scientific policy was reframed by the lessons of conflict. The Scientific Intersectional
                            Council created a tiered approval regime for potentially dangerous technologies and
                            maintained a strict, documented chain of custody for any materials and methods associated
                            with mass-scale destructive capabilities. Where necessary, references to NBM-derived weaponry
                            are limited to explicit archival records and highly controlled scientific contexts.
                        </p>

                        <h2>From Planetary Confederation to Stellar Nation</h2>
                        <p>
                            With internal stability improving, the Syndicate initiated a deliberate, council-driven
                            program of outward expansion. The program emphasized collective scientific effort,
                            ecological responsibility, and federated decision-making for exploration policy.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Hyperlane Scientific Development and Exploration Strategy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Faster-than-light transit reached practical application following a long period of
                            observational and experimental science. Researchers discovered that certain naturally
                            occurring field geometries in interstellar space form persistent, chartable corridors
                            — Hyperlanes — which do not depend on continuous artificial maintenance. This
                            discovery made Hyperlanes the most natural and technically accessible first form of
                            FTL for Syndicate science teams.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Syndicate's scientific programme proceeded cautiously: laboratory validation of
                            theoretical models, unmanned probes for route confirmation, and progressively longer
                            crewed trials under multi-council oversight. As of this entry (2099.12.27), the first
                            manned FTL-capable vessel was launched only days prior, and orbital shipyard facilities
                            to support ongoing hull production and mission preparation were established in the same
                            timeframe. Crews and mission charters operate under transparent mandates drawn from the
                            Federation's science commons and subject to civilian oversight.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Early operational priorities emphasized careful mapping, safety protocols for transit,
                            and open scientific exchange rather than the construction of persistent maintenance
                            infrastructure. Emphasis remains on the federated scientific governance practices
                            derived from The Workers Papers and the Worker's Tools: shared data, rotating crews,
                            and publishable procedures for replication and review.
                        </p>

                            The Current Era continues to be defined by the tension between decentralization and the
                            practical demands of planetary and interstellar logistics. The constitution, paired with
                            continuous civic engagement, is the Syndicate's primary safeguard against the return of

                            The Syndicate is now transitioning from repair to proactive expansion: construction of
                            Hyperlane nodes, deployment of exploration convoys, and an ambitious program to map and
                            build cooperative waystations across nearby stellar systems. Exploration effort remains
                            embedded in the same democratic frameworks that govern the homeworld.
