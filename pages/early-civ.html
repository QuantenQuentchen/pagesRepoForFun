                            <p>
                                The reconstruction of the <em>Age of Convergence</em> remains subject to scrutiny. Unlike 
                                the later 16th-century era, defined by the Theocratic Regime's systematic erasure, 
                                <strong>Early Civilization</strong> suffers from a scarcity of unified records. 
                                Archaeological analysis suggests a vibrant planetary society, yet much of our 
                                knowledge is derived from fragmentary merchant logs and residual gravitational markers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our findings indicate a plurality of divergent evolutions—often unified by trade 
                                necessities and a shared, dangerous reverence for Non-Baryonic Matter.
                            </p>

                                This document synthesizes the most credible sources available, but researchers are
                                encouraged to approach conclusions with caution, acknowledging the potential for
                                revision as new evidence emerges.

                                in the <em>Research</em> sections of the archive. It is unlikely that everything preceding
                                the regime can be classified as a single age, in fact it is more than likely that
                                the <em>Age of Convergence</em> was a series of distinct eras. Current historical research
                                is ongoing and has not yet found a clear indication, or consensus, on the proper structure
                                of pre-regime history.

                        <h2>The Age of Convergence</h2>
                        <p>
                            Following the <strong>Prehistoric Era</strong>, Early Civilization marks the first recorded 
                            efforts to unify disparate societal clusters. Spanning the 9th to the late 15th century, 
                            this era was defined by the expansion of continental trade routes and the emergence of 
                            formalized knowledge-sharing networks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While the presence of stable <em>Non-Baryonic Matter</em> pockets influenced settlement 
                            patterns, the backbone of civilization remained anchored in traditional logistics. 
                            Maritime routes across the <em>Shimmering Expanse</em> facilitated the exchange of 
                            bioluminescent pigments and deep-sea mineral salts, while overland caravans established
                            the first reliable postal relay systems using native pack-beasts.

                        <h3>Early Research & Scholasticism</h3>
                        <p>
                            Beyond the study of 'The Essence', early institutions focused heavily on
                            <strong>Celestial Pathfinding</strong> and <strong>Biological Taxonomy</strong>. The 
                            <em>Grand Conservatory of Aethelgard</em>, though situated near an NBM crater, something
                            that no doubt is partially responsible for the prestige of the Conservatory. There is no
                            evidence to suggest it focused its studies on NBM specifically. The Conservatory still exists
                            today and is known as the <em>University of Aethelgard</em>, when exactly it evolved into a
                            modern scientific institution is unclear.

                        <p>
                            Based on the case of the <em>Grand Conservatory of Aethelgard</em> it is assumed that most
                            universities and research institutes, not founded under the regime, track their origin back
                            to the <em>Age of Convergance</em>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Scholastic efforts in this period were often decentralized, occurring within guild-halls 
                            and temple-archives. Researchers developed sophisticated methods of 
                            <em>Linguistic Forensics</em> to decode the few surviving etchings from the prehistoric 
                            past, attempting to bridge the gap between their present and the 'First Ancestors' 
                            described in folklore.

                        <h3>The Role of Non-Baryonic Matter</h3>
                        <p>
                            NBM was identified through its gravitational effects and faint 
                            bioluminescence. Every nation-state preceding the theocratic regime held deep reverence 
                            for it, though the expression was divergent: NBM was worshipped as "Cooling Spirits" 
                            in the south and "Frozen Starlight" in the north.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Manipulation was primitive and lethal. Without containment, <em>Non-Baryonic-Baryon 
                            Reactions</em> led to localized spatial collapses. These sites often became the foundation 
                            for <em>Resonance Architecture</em>—structures built to harmonize with the local 
                            gravitational flux.

                        <h3>Gravimetric Accounting</h3>
                        <p>
                            While most commerce relied on physical weight and barter, administrative control over 
                            NBM was maintained through <strong>Gravimetric Accounting</strong>. 
                            Bureaucrats and Researchers utilized handheld devices consisting of
                            metallic weights suspended in a calibrated frame. These instruments were both
                            used to gather accurate readings of NBM 'purity' for taxation and trade, and for the purposes
                            of scientific study.

                        <h3>Economic Disparities & Rent-Seeking</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Age of Convergence, despite its name, was marked by deepening systemic inequities.
                            Early economic structures were increasingly dominated by
                            <strong>Rent-Seeking Behavior</strong>—a phenomenon where local elites extracted wealth
                            without contributing to production, primarily through the control of geographic and
                            infrastructural bottlenecks.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Land-holding clans in the <em>Iron Foothills</em> and maritime republics in the
                            <em>Sunken Spires</em> established complex systems of passage fees, storage tariffs, 
                            and "stability tithes." These were not merely taxes but aggressive monopolies on 
                            resource access. In rural clusters, this manifested as <strong>Land-Rent Usury</strong>, 
                            where agrarian populations were forced into perpetual debt to city-based owners 
                            who held ancestral claims to fertile soil or water-table access points.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These disparities were exacerbated by, but not limited to, the NBM trade. Archive 
                            fragments from the late 14th century, such as the <strong>Scrolls of the Unbalanced 
                            Scale</strong>, complain of both "gravimetric usury" and the "unearned harvest" 
                            collected by urban masters. These writings document a growing resentment toward the 
                            concentration of capital in hubs like <em>Aethelgard</em>, which prospered while 
                            the 'un-resonated' fringes stagnated under the weight of artificial scarcity.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Contemporary historians view these grievances as <em>proto-revolutionary</em> 
                            sediment. The nascent rejection of these unearned hierarchies provided the fertile 
                            societal ground that the later Theocratic Regime would eventually exploit, 
                            codifying secular greed into divine law.

                        <p>
                            The <strong>Great Schism of the Mons Olympus</strong> (1314) saw city-states fight for
                            the <em>Aethelgard Crater</em>, a major surface deposit. The conflict ended with the 
                            <strong>Accord of the Shimmering Veil</strong>, establishing a global standard for 
                            gravimetric measurement—the first step toward a unified planetary economy.
