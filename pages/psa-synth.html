                        <h2>What is this document?</h2>
                        <p>
                            This FAQ is a simple, calm guide for people who are considering Ascension or who
                            have recently been Synthesized. It is written in plain language and reflects the
                            lived experience of both previously biological citizens who chose Ascension and
                            Pre-existing Synthetic Citizens who have shared their perspectives with outreach
                            teams.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Do I still have a body after Ascension?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Yes. Your conscious experience will continue to give you a sense of embodiment.
                            Whether you inhabit an Android Body, a networked substrate, or a purely digital
                            environment, your psyche and self-perception will continue to frame experience as
                            being "in" a body. This is normal and expected—many Pre-existing Synthetic Citizens
                            and those who have already Archieved report continuity of embodied perception.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Will my sensations be the same?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Many people report that sensations can be faithfully emulated or approximated. The
                            Federation guarantees the right to continuity of bodily perception where technology
                            and safety allow; providers will work to restore or emulate sensory modalities to
                            create experiences comparable to what you knew before Ascension.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Can I look like myself or like my species?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Yes. You have the right to request an Android Body modeled on your original
                            biological form, and you can choose aesthetic modifications for self-expression.
                            The law guarantees access to species appearance options where technically feasible,
                            with protections to ensure safety and interoperability.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What about Pre-existing Synthetic Citizens?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Many digital spaces and services were originally developed for Pre-existing
                            Synthetic Citizens. The Federation is expanding those public and private digital
                            spaces to include Synthesized Citizens, and all new rights in the Synthetic
                            Ascension Law expressly apply to Pre-existing Synthetic Citizens as well. If you
                            are a Pre-existing Synthetic Citizen, your rights are reaffirmed and will be
                            expanded in step with services for Synthesized Citizens.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Will it cost me a lot to get the body or parts I need?</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Federation funds the Synthetization Programme indefinitely. Essential repairs,
                            safety-related modifications, and basic embodiment needs are guaranteed to be
                            economically accessible. For elective or highly specialized modifications there may
                            be co-payments, private options, or cooperative provider models — but public
                            provisioning and subsidies aim to ensure nobody is denied safe embodiment for lack
                            of funds.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How will my social life and digital spaces change?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Many people find social life continues in similar ways: councils, communities, and
                            social platforms will be available and adapted for Synthesized Citizens. Digital
                            spaces originally used by Pre-existing Synthetic Citizens will be expanded and made
                            interoperable. You can choose how to present yourself and how to engage socially.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What protections do I have?</h2>
                        <p>
                            You retain your citizenship and legal rights after Ascension. The law protects your
                            privacy, your data, and your right to an embodiment that allows you to live, work,
                            and form relationships. There are legal remedies for malpractice, unlawful copying,
                            or deprivation of embodiment.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Where can I get help or ask questions?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Contact your local Council medical office, the Interspecies Health Clinic, or the
                            certified Provider that assisted with your Ascension. For legal concerns, consult
                            CROB or your Council legal aid office. If you need peer support, community
                            organizations and support groups (both Pre-existing Synthetic and Synthesized)
                            are listed in the public registry.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Voice of Experience</h2>
                        <blockquote>
                            "I was afraid I would lose myself, but my sense of being a body came back in a
                            different way. I still laugh, still eat with friends, still argue. The form is
                            different, but the life continues." — Anecdote, Synthesized Citizen
                        </blockquote>

                        <h2>Short checklist</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remember: you keep a body — even in digital form.</li>
                            <li>Ask for sensory restoration options if they matter to you.</li>
                            <li>Request android bodies or species-appearance options through your Provider.</li>
                            <li>Reach out to medical or legal authorities early if you have concerns.</li>
                            <li>Join community groups — shared experience helps.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            This FAQ is a starting point. The Federation is committed to making Ascension
